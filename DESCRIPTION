Title: Run the GSEA java pacakage from inside R
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jonathan Ross Hart
Maintainer: Jonathan Ross Hart <jonathan@jonathanrosshart.com>
Description: GSEA is a great tool for analysis of gene expression data.  There
    are many times when it is inconvenient to run GSEA using its GUI when all of
    your gene expression data is already in R.  Wouldn't it be nice to just run
    GSEA from inside of R?  That is what this pacakage does.  It also will let
    you make high resolution graphics of the enrichment plots that GSEA emits.
